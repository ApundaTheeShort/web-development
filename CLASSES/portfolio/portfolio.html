          <li>Water Billing Project</li>
          <p>
            A water billing program project involves the development of software
            to manage and streamline the process of billing customers for water
            usage. This program typically includes functionalities such as
            recording water consumption data, calculating bills based on usage
            and rates, generating invoices, managing customer accounts, and
            facilitating payment processing. The project aims to automate manual
            billing processes, improve accuracy in billing calculations, enhance
            customer service through timely and transparent billing information,
            and increase efficiency in administrative tasks related to water
            billing.
          </p>
          <li>Web Development Project</li>
          <p>
            Currently I am working on a website that will help my community
            farmers and the farmers around to easily acquire farm inputs through
            their phone and sell the finished farm produce online, cutting off
            middle men and making more revenue.
          </p>
          <li>Personal Portfolio Website</li>
          <p>
            As you can see, the end product of this project is slowly coming out
            in this website of mine. It's still a work in progress.
